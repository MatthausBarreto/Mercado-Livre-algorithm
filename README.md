The code question was pretty much getting a random integer between 0 and 9999 and count the amount of numbers between 0 and input number that has the sum of it's digits equal to 21. Also set a random integer between 0 and 9 as a condition, numbers with digits equal or greater than the condition wouldn't be validated in the count.

couldn't figure it out back then since it was in Java, after the test, I came up with a solution in Python as i'm more comfortable with the language.
